Title: Conic Bundles and Quartic Plane Curves over the Reals

Abstract:

A conic bundle is a morphism between smooth varieties $\pi: X \to S$ such that every fiber is a conic and the generic fiber is a smooth conic. In this presentation, 
we are concerned with the case when $S = \mathbb{P}_{[u:v:w]}^2$ and $X$ is defined by equation of the form $z^2 = Q_1(u, v, w)t_0^2 + 2Q_2(u, v, w)t_0 t_1 + Q_3(u, v, w)t_1^2$.
This conic bundle has a discriminant curve $\Delta = (Q_1Q_3 - Q_2^2 = 0) \subset \mathbb{P}_{[u:v:w]}^2$ that is a real smooth quartic plane curve. 
This talk will introduce the preliminaries necessary to understand these notions and present some results connecting the topological type of the discriminant curve with
desired properties of the conic bundle.


A conic is a curve defined by a degree 2 polynomial. In this talk, we consider bundles of conics over RP^2 whose general member is smooth and such that the locus in RP^2 of singular members is a degree 4 curve. 
This talk will introduce these objects and present some results exploring the relationship between the topology of this degree 4 curve and the total space of the conic bundle.


Conic Bundles over the Real Projective Plane

A conic is a curve defined by a homogenous polynomial of 2. In this talk, we consider bundles of conics over the real project plane whose
general member is smooth and such that the locus of singular members is a degree 4 curve. It turns out that every real smooth quartic can
be classified into 1 of 6 topological types. This talk will introduce these objects and present some results exploring the relationship between
the topology of this degree 4 curve and the total space of the conic bundle.
